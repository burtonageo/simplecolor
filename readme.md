#SimpleColor

A library which contains Generic Rgb and Rgba colors, and common functions for
manipulating them. Intended to be used standalone, or to complement matrix/vector
math libraries like CGMath, Vecmath, or Nalgebra in graphics programming. This is a
minimal color library, and I have no intention to expand it with other formats or
fancy colorspaces (if you want that functionality, use color-rs).

Requires rust-nightly. Released under the terms of the MIT license.
